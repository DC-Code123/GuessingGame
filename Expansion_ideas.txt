Guessing Game Expansion Ideas (Prioritized)
===========================================

1. Write unit and integration tests for all modules
   - Ensure code reliability and maintainability by thoroughly testing all components.

2. Refactor code for modularity and readability
   - Improve the codebase structure to make it easier to maintain and extend.

3. Document all public functions and modules
   - Provide clear documentation for all code to help future contributors and users.

4. Implement difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard)
   - Allow players to select a difficulty, which could affect the guessing range, number of attempts, or hint availability.

5. Allow user to set custom guessing range
   - Give players the option to define their own minimum and maximum values for the secret number.

6. Implement a hint system with limited uses
   - Restrict the number of hints a player can use per game to increase challenge and strategy.

7. Add a leaderboard to track high scores
   - Implement a system to record and display the best scores achieved by players. This could be stored locally or online.

8. Support multiple rounds and show stats at the end
   - Let players play several rounds in a session and display statistics such as average guesses, wins, and losses.

9. Add achievements or badges for milestones
   - Reward players with achievements for reaching certain goals, such as consecutive wins or fast guesses.

10. Add a timer for each guess and track fastest times
    - Introduce a timer to measure how quickly players make guesses and keep records of the fastest rounds.

11. Export game results to a file (CSV/JSON)
    - Allow players to save their game history and statistics for later review.

12. Add support for multiplayer (hotseat or networked)
    - Enable multiple players to compete either on the same device or over a network.

13. Create a GUI version using egui or another Rust GUI library
    - Develop a graphical interface for the game to make it more accessible and visually appealing.

14. Add localization/multi-language support
    - Translate the game into multiple languages to reach a broader audience.

15. Add sound effects for correct/incorrect guesses
    - Enhance the user experience by playing sounds when a guess is right or wrong.
